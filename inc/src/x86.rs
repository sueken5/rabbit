/*
The implementation of insl (0412) is worth looking at more closely. Rep insl is
actually a tight loop masquerading as a single instruction. The rep prefix executes the
following instruction %ecx times, decrementing %ecx after each iteration. The insl
instruction reads a 32-bit value from port %dx into memory at address %edi and then
increments %edi by 4. Thus rep insl copies 4Ã—%ecx bytes, in 32-bit chunks, from
port %dx into memory starting at address %edi.
